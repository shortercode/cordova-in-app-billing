# Getting Started with In App Purchases ( IAP )

This is a guide, written as I fumble my way through the process myself, to creating an Android or iOS application with in app purchases!

## Android

### Step 1; creating an android developer account

*If you already have an android developer and merchant account you can skip ahead to section 2.*

For this stage you will need a google account, which will become your developer account, and a credit card. Signing up as a developer requires a one off registration fee of $25, so make sure you sign up with the google account you actually want to use.

Head over to https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/ and you will be prompted with a fairly short set of forms. Fill them out and pay the toll and you should now have your developer account.

Now you'll now be shown a long form with lots of information for your application, this can  be a little scary. But don't worry too much, you don't have to fill it all in yet. Fill in a few of the easier ones and hit the save draft button at the top of the form. You'll need to come back to this form before you publish, but we can worry about that later.

You should now have your basic application registered, and you'll be on the applications main menu. At this point you can actually
